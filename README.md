# SuperFizzBuzz Solution in C#

I was asked this exercise in a coding interview I had, the idea behind this simple assesment is to discard 99% of coders that cannot code a simple FizzBuzz solution, in this case there are extra features in top of the simple FizzBuzz classic problem.

### Classic Fizz Buzz

Classic fizzbuzz output is typically described as “Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of 3, print “Fizz” instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print “Buzz”. For Multiples of 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”

### Advanced Fizz Buzz
-	Can produce fizzbuzz output for a user-supplied range of numbers – e.g., from 2 to 35, or from 1 to 1,000,000,000, or from -1 to -35, etc.
- Can produce output for a user supplied set of integers, even if they’re not sequential.
- Can generate tokens other than “Fizz” and “Buzz” and can evaluate division by numbers other than 3 and 5.  Maybe a user wants to test division by 4, 13, and 9, and output “Frog”, “Duck,” and “Chicken” for them (e.g., in this case, 52 would ouput “FrogDuck”, 36 would output “FrogChicken”, 468 would output “FrogDuckChicken”, etc.)
